# Object-detction-with-localization-By-using-YOLO-algorithm
This project is used for the detection and localization of objects with bounding boxes. The information regarding the project are as follow- 
1. In this project, I used YOLO(you only look once) algorithm with 106 layers and pre-trained weights of the YOLO version3, which trained on the COCO(common objects in contact) dataset. 
2. This dataset has 80 object categories and 91 stuff categories.
3. I used three anchor boxes and a class probability threshold value of 0.6. 
4. I used the Keras framework for building the YOLO model.
