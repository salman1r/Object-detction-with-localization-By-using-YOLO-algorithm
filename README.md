# Object-detction-with-localization-By-using-YOLO-algorithm
This project is used for the detection and localization of objects with bounding boxes. The information regarding the project are as follow-  In this project, I used YOLO(you only look once) algorithm with 106 layers and pre-trained weights of the YOLO version3, which trained on the COCO(common objects in contact) dataset.  This dataset has 80 object categories and 91 stuff categories.  I used three anchor boxes and a class probability threshold value of 0.6.  I used the Keras framework for building the YOLO model.
